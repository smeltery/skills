# /improve-codebase-architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** —
refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones, where a small interface
hides a lot of behavior.

## Vocabulary

The skill is strict about terminology — see [`LANGUAGE.md`](./LANGUAGE.md) for
the full glossary.

- **Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation.
- **Interface** — everything a caller must know.
- **Depth** — leverage at the interface.
- **Seam** — where an interface lives.
- **Adapter** — concrete thing satisfying an interface at a seam.

## Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  E[Explore] --> P[Present numbered<br/>deepening candidates]
  P --> U{User picks one}
  U --> G[Grilling loop:<br/>walk the design tree]
  G --> S[Side effects:<br/>update CONTEXT.md / ADRs]
```

## Key heuristic

The **deletion test**: imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it
was a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning
its keep.

## Install

```bash
npx skills@latest add smeltery/skills
```

## Caveat

The skill references `CONTEXT.md` (a domain glossary) and `docs/adr/` (ADRs)
that the companion [`/grill-with-docs`](../grill-with-docs/README.md) skill
is responsible for creating. Both files are *informative* — the skill still
runs without them, it just won't have project-specific vocabulary to name
candidates. Run `/grill-with-docs` first if you want maximum value here.

## Files

- [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) — canonical skill definition.
- [`LANGUAGE.md`](./LANGUAGE.md) — vocabulary used in every suggestion.
- [`DEEPENING.md`](./DEEPENING.md) — how to deepen safely given a candidate's dependency category.
- [`INTERFACE-DESIGN.md`](./INTERFACE-DESIGN.md) — parallel sub-agent pattern for "design it twice".
