# /tdd

Test-driven development with a **red-green-refactor** loop. Vertical slices via
tracer bullets — one test, one implementation, repeat. Tests describe behavior
through public interfaces, not implementation details, so they survive
refactors.

## The loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  R[RED<br/>write failing test] --> G[GREEN<br/>minimal code to pass]
  G --> F[REFACTOR<br/>only while GREEN]
  F --> R
```

The skill is explicit that **horizontal slicing** — write all tests, then all
implementation — produces crap tests. Always go vertical.

## Install

```bash
npx skills@latest add smeltery/skills
```

Or copy just this skill (note: `tdd` references companion files, so copying
just `SKILL.md` will leave dangling links — prefer the npx flow):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/tdd
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smeltery/skills/main/skills/engineering/tdd/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md
```

## Usage

Trigger when starting a new feature or fixing a bug — "build this with TDD",
"red-green-refactor", "test-first".
