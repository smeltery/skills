description: Proves that a code change meets its acceptance criteria. Uses focused automated checks and a real browser for browser-facing work. Use to verify a diff, branch, PR, URL, or user flow against AC-n/INV-n IDs from a design or task. Use tdd instead when building new behavior test-first.

# Verify

## Workflow

1. Read the task, its source design when present, changed code, existing tests, and repository instructions. Acceptance criteria come from the task or approved design. Preserve their wording and `AC-n` or `INV-n` IDs. Never rewrite criteria to match the code.
2. Map every acceptance criterion, cited invariant, and affected failure path to proof by ID. Test changed behavior and behavior a refactor must preserve.
3. If automated tests cannot exercise the affected behavior, explain why and give other evidence.
4. Add or update focused tests where proof is missing. Assertions should fail when the changed behavior breaks.
5. Assert behavior a user or caller can observe unless the test targets a documented internal contract. Keep setup and assertions no more complex than the scenario.
6. Run the narrowest checks that exercise the changed behavior and affected interfaces. Run wider checks when shared behavior or interfaces changed.
7. When browser-rendered behavior changes, start the documented app and check the required flows and affected failures in a real browser.
   - Check desktop and mobile when layout or responsive styles changed.
   - Check keyboard use when interactions changed.
   - Check console errors and failed requests during every flow.
   - Capture evidence. Reading source is not browser proof.
8. Report each `AC-n`, `INV-n`, or task criterion as pass, fail, or unverified. Include the command, browser flow, or other evidence.

## Boundaries

- Do not weaken assertions to make a change pass.
- Do not fix unrelated failures.
- If required browser tooling is unavailable, report the check as blocked unless the user explicitly accepts a manual exception.

## Related skills

- Use [`tdd`](../tdd/README.md) to build new behavior test-first. Use this skill afterward, or on someone else's change, to prove specific `AC-n`/`INV-n` IDs against what already exists.
- Use [`design`](../design/README.md) to produce the acceptance criteria and invariants this skill proves.
- Use [`review`](../review/README.md) for an independent read of the implementation itself; this skill only proves the stated criteria.
