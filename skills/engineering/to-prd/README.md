# /to-prd

Turn the current conversation context into a Product Requirements Document and
publish it to the project issue tracker. **No interview** — synthesizes from
what's already been discussed.

## Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  E[Explore repo] --> M[Sketch modules<br/>look for deep modules]
  M --> U{User confirms<br/>modules + tests}
  U --> W[Write PRD]
  W --> P[Publish with<br/>needs-triage label]
```

## Install

```bash
npx skills@latest add smeltery/skills
```

## PRD template

The skill emits a fixed-section PRD: Problem Statement, Solution, User Stories
(numbered, actor-benefit), Implementation Decisions, Testing Decisions, Out of
Scope, Further Notes.

## Caveat

Like `/to-issues`, this skill expects an issue tracker and triage label
vocabulary configured upstream. Hand-configure or install the upstream
`setup-matt-pocock-skills` skill before invoking.
