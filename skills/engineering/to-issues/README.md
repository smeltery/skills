# /to-issues

Break a plan, spec, or PRD into independently-grabbable issues using
**tracer-bullet vertical slices**. Each slice cuts through every layer
(schema, API, UI, tests) so it's demoable on its own.

## Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  C[Gather context] --> E[Explore codebase]
  E --> D[Draft vertical slices]
  D --> Q[Quiz user]
  Q -->|approved| P[Publish issues<br/>in dependency order]
  Q -->|revise| D
```

Each slice is tagged **HITL** (needs human input) or **AFK** (agent-runnable
end-to-end). Prefer AFK.

## Install

```bash
npx skills@latest add smeltery/skills
```

## Usage

Run after a plan/PRD is in conversation context. Optionally pass an existing
issue reference as the source.

## Caveat

This skill expects a configured issue tracker and triage label vocabulary.
Upstream `mattpocock/skills` ships a `setup-matt-pocock-skills` skill that
provides that config — it isn't ported here. Either install that skill
upstream or hand-configure your tracker before invoking `/to-issues`.
