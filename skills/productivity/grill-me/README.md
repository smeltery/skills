# /grill-me

Get interviewed relentlessly about a plan or design until you reach shared
understanding with the agent. Walks the design tree branch-by-branch,
resolving dependencies between decisions one at a time.

For each question, the agent provides its recommended answer — so the
interview is opinionated, not a blank stare.

## Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Q[Ask one question<br/>+ recommended answer] --> A[Wait for user]
  A --> R{Resolved?}
  R -->|yes| N[Walk to next branch]
  R -->|no| Q
  N --> Q
  N -->|tree fully resolved| D[Done]
```

If a question can be answered by reading the codebase, the skill explores the
codebase instead of asking.

## Install

```bash
npx skills@latest add smeltery/skills
```

Or copy just this skill:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/grill-me
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smeltery/skills/main/skills/productivity/grill-me/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/grill-me/SKILL.md
```

## Usage

Trigger by saying "grill me", "stress-test this plan", or "interview me about
this design".

For code-specific grilling that also updates `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs as
decisions land, see [`/grill-with-docs`](../../engineering/grill-with-docs/README.md).
