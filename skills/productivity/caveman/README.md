# /caveman

Ultra-compressed communication mode. Cuts token usage ~75% by dropping
filler, articles, and pleasantries while keeping full technical accuracy.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  T[Trigger:<br/>user says<br/>caveman / brief / less tokens] --> A[Active mode]
  A -->|every response| A
  A -->|security warning<br/>or destructive op| C[Drop temporarily<br/>for clarity]
  C --> A
  A -->|stop caveman<br/>or normal mode| O[Off]
```

Once activated, stays active across turns. Technical substance — code, errors,
exact terminology — is never abbreviated.

## Install

```bash
npx skills@latest add smeltery/skills
```

Or copy just this skill:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/caveman
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smeltery/skills/main/skills/productivity/caveman/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/caveman/SKILL.md
```

## Usage

Trigger by saying "caveman mode", "talk like caveman", "be brief", "less
tokens", or `/caveman`. Disable with "stop caveman" or "normal mode".
