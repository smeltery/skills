# /handoff

Compact the current conversation into a **handoff document** so another
agent can pick up the work. The doc lives at a `mktemp` path so it doesn't
clutter the repo, and references existing artifacts (PRDs, plans, ADRs,
issues, commits, diffs) by path or URL rather than duplicating them.

## Usage

Trigger when you're about to end a session and want the next agent (or
yourself, tomorrow) to start without re-reading the whole transcript.

The skill takes an optional argument describing what the next session will
focus on — pass it to tailor the doc accordingly. Example:

```text
/handoff finish the migration and run the smoke tests
```

If no argument is provided, the doc summarises the whole conversation.

## What it produces

- A markdown file at `$(mktemp -t handoff-XXXXXX.md)` containing:
  - The current state of the work.
  - References to existing artifacts (no duplication).
  - A suggested set of skills for the next session.
